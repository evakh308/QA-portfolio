Hi, I'm Eva, a Junior manual QA engineer with a strong interest in QA Automation. I have hands-on experience in web, mobile, and API testing. I've also performed UI automation testing using JavaScript(Playwright) and Python(Selenium). My goal is to improve my skills as a manual QA engineer and grow in the field of automation testing
